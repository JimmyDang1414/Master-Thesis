# Master-Thesis

First I gathered data from students with a survey I prepared in french as well as in english. The data is not displayed in the repo due to confidentiality. 

Then I used R files to clean and prepare the data for analysis (one for data from a french survey, 
another for data from an english survey). 

Finally I performed the statistical analysis with Stata, using a do-file.
