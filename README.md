# Master-Thesis

First I gathered data, not displayed in the repo due to confidentiality. 
Then I used R files to clean and prepare the data for analysis (one for data from a french survey 
another for data from an english survey). 
Finally I performed the statistical analysis with Stata, using a do-file.
